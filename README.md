# React Router

"Book Explorer" is a multi-page React application built using React Router to provide a seamless client-side navigation experience. 

The app features dedicated routes for Home, Book List, Book Details, and About pages, with nested routing implemented within the Book List to dynamically display individual book details via URL parameters (e.g., /books/:bookId) using the useParams() hook. 

A default redirect from / to /books is handled using the <Navigate> component, while a wildcard route (path="*") gracefully manages invalid URLs by rendering a custom NotFound page.
