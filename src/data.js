  { id: 3, title: "React Router", description: "React Router is a powerful library for handling routing in React applications. It enables dynamic navigation between views or components without reloading the page, making your app feel fast and seamless. React Router uses a declarative approach, allowing you to define routes as components. With features like nested routing, route parameters, and navigation guards, it helps you build complex UIs easily. The <Routes> and <Route> components define the structure, while <Link> and <NavLink> are used for internal navigation. <Outlet /> allows child routes to be rendered within parent layouts. React Router also supports programmatic navigation using the useNavigate() hook. Error handling can be added with an errorElement in route definitions. It works well with createBrowserRouter() for modern, data-driven routing. Overall, React Router is essential for building multi-page SPAs with React." },
